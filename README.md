Momentum is an analog of the Chrome online store application of the same name. The app shows the time and the user's name. The background image and greeting change depending on the time of day.
The app has a clock, an image slider, weather widgets, an audio player, and a quote of the day. Local storage is used to store the user's name and locality.
